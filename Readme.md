Hi üññüèΩ this is an **clickup filter with colors effect**, The project was made with React Native using **Expo** and **Typescript**

![Gif ClickUp](https://github.com/felipeamodio/filter-clickup/blob/main/clickup.gif)

## Functionality
The project's functionality is very simple, it simulates a horizontal filter at the top of the page, and when we click on the filter options it **changes the background color** based on the color of each of the filter options.

## Libs

These are the libs used in the project:
- [React Native Svg](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/svg/)

## Open and run the project

Clone this repository with **git clone https://github.com/felipeamodio/Funny-Filters** or download the files, and after that:
- run **yarn** or **npm i** to install all depencencies 
- run **npx expo start**
- this project only works with your physical cell phone, so download Expo Go in stores and read the QR-Code with your cell phone that will appear after you run the expo start command in the terminal
